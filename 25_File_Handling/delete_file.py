# Delete a File :-
# To delete a file, you must import the OS module, and run its or.remove() function:
import os
os.remove("demofile.txt")

# Check if File exist :-
# To avoid getting an error, you might want to check if the file exists before you try to delete it:
import os
if os.path.exists("demofile.txt"):
    os.remove("demofile.txt")
else: 
    print("The file does not exist!")

# Delete Folder :-
# To delete an entire folder, use the os.rmdir() method: 
import os
os.rmdir("myfolder")

# Note: You can only remove empty folders.
