# The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.

# The except block lets you handle the error.

# The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.

# The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

# Exception Handling :-
# When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.

# These exceptions can be handled using the try statement:
try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("An exception occurred")

# Since the try block raises an error, the except block will be executed.

# Without the try block, the program will crash and raise an error:

# Many Exceptions :-
# You can define as many exception blocks as you want, e.g. if you want to execute a special block of code for a special kind of error:
try:
  print(x)
except NameError:
  print("Variable x is not defined")
except:
  print("Something else went wrong")

# Else :-
# You can use the else keyword to define a block of code to be executed if no errors were raised:
try:
  print("Hello")
except:
  print("Something went wrong")
else:
  print("Nothing went wrong")

# Finally :-
# The finally block, if specified, will be executed regardless if the try block raises an error or not.
try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("Something went wrong")
finally:
  print("The 'try except' is finished")

# Raise an exception
x = -1

if x < 0:
  raise Exception("Sorry, no numbers below zero")
