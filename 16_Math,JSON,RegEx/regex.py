# A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

# RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.

# RegEx Module :-
# Python has a built-in package called re, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.

# Import the re module:
import re

# RegEx in Python
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("^The.*Spain$", txt)

# RegEx Functions
# findall() - The findall() function returns a list containing all matches.
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.findall("ai", txt)
print(x)

# search() - The search() function searches the string for a match, and returns a Match object if there is a match.
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("\s", txt)

print("The first white-space character is located in position:", x.start())

# split() - The split() function returns a list where the string has been split at each match: 
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.split("\s", txt)
print(x)

# sub() - The sub() function replaces the matches with the text of your choice:
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.sub("\s", "9", txt)
print(x)

# Match Object
# A Match Object is an object containing information about the search and the result.
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("ai", txt)
print(x) #this will print an object

# The Match object has properties and methods used to retrieve information about the search, and the result:

# .span() returns a tuple containing the start-, and end positions of the match.
# .string returns the string passed into the function
# .group() returns the part of the string where there was a match
